# NGUBER (A mock Uber app)
> By: Baskoro Indrayana, Davin, Ivan Hadi Putra, Jonathan Tandarma, and Ted.

## Description
This is a project I submitted for the Information Security course I took in Zhejiang University.

It is a demonstration (more like a _simulation_) of a mock Uber application. In this project we try to solve problems that Uber and other Chinese online taxi providers face.
